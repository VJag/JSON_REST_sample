Sample project to help to setup a mock server.

Prerequisite:
************
Node should have been installed, and the source is pulled into a local directory.

Steps to setup and run:
-----------------------
1. Run npm install in the directory where code is. This should pull all the required dependecies.
2. Start the application by typing: node server.js


If everything is setup fine, http://localhost:9999/countries from your browser should return a JSON with details of the countries of the world.

Update server.js to map URL's to other resources for your testing.

Good Luck!!!
