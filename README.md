Sample project to help to setup a mock server.

Start the application by typing: node server.js

If everything is setup fine,http://localhost:9999/countries from your browser should return a JSON with verious details of countries of the world.

Update server.js to map URL's to other resources for your testing.

Good Luck!!!
